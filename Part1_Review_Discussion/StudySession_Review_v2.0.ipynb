    " \n",
    "   At this moment, Generator has found a point in latent space, through which it is able to fool the discriminator. Therefore, discriminator predicts higher probabilities of this generated image be like a \"real\" one. This point is called the ***MODE***. If we keep on training the generator without training the discriminator, then Generator would find a point in latent space through which it could food the discriminator. Subsequent iterations of training, the generator would continue to sample points from a similar area, thereby continuing to fool the discriminator and essentially reducing the loss to zero. Even if we train the discriminator after this, the generator would find another ***MODE*** point to fool the generator.\n",

    " - Uninformative Loss\n",

    "   From the basic concept of ML/AI, the idea of learning for a model is to ***continously reduce the LOSS***. However, as we see in the LOSS graphs above, the LOSS of the generator keeps on increasing, however, the quality of the images keep on increasing. This is because, the LOSS of the generator is judged on the basis of the current capability of the Discriminator. Therefore, in essence we should ***not compare the loss of a GENERATOR Vs DISCRIMINATOR***. This lack of correlation between the quality of images generated and loss of generator make GAN training non intuitive.\n",
